<p>We now know what we have access to in this dataset. It is a collection of numerical, categorical and textual features used to describe a PR. This gives us a lot of potential avenues to explore from an EDA and Data Science perspective. But is also creates an additional challenge insofar as we’ll need to do a bit of feature engineering to get this data into format that is ready to be ingested by any ML models.</p>

<p>Let’s look at the distribution of the time to merge column. This can help us determine what the setup for ML problems such as <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aicoe-aiops/ocp-ci-analysis/issues/236">#236</a> could be like. That is, should the time to merge problem be framed as a regression or classification problem.</p>
<p>First, lets try to determine what the granularity of the output values should be, in case of a regression setup. That is, should the model predict time to merge in number of seconds, number of hours, number of days, or some other chunk of time.</p>

<p>From the above outputs we can see that if we bucket the data into 3 hours, then roughly 65% of the data points would have the value “1”, 5% would have the value “2”, 3% would have the value 3, and so on. Lets explore what this would look like with an “hours” granularity.</p>

<p>From the above outputs we can see that if we bucket the data into hours, then roughly 55% of the data points would have the value “1”, 5% would have the value “2”, 3% would have the value 3, and so on.</p>
<p>As we make it more granular (e.g. minutes), the distribution would get even more uniform. However, a granularity finer than 1 hour might not provide any additional value to the end user. So we will go with granularity of 1 hour for our regression setup.</p>
<p>Now, lets try to determine, if we were to set this up as a classification problem, what the output classes should be. In the following cell, we’ll try to split the time-to-merge values into 10 equally populated buckets.</p>

<p>If we want to frame our ML problem as a classification problem, equally sized buckets that can define the classes are class 0 is “merged within 1 minute”, class 1 is “merged within 2 mins”, class 2 is “merged within 5 minutes”, class 3 is “merged within 10 mins”, class 4 is “merged within 30 mins”, class 5 is “merged within 2 hrs”, class 6 is “merged within 8 hrs”, class 7 is “merged within 17 hrs”, class 8 is “merged within 4 days”, class 9 is “merged in greater than 4 days”.</p>
<p><strong>Body</strong></p>
<p>Here, we will derive a feature called <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">body_size</span></code> which will simply be the number of words in the body of the PR. We can use this numerical value to describe the body of the PR.</p>

<p>From the above graph, we can see that titles often contain some keywords that can hint towards the type of changes being made in the PR. We will create a feature which is a vector indicating how many times each word appeared in the title. This way, even if a less prominent word is more correlated with time_to_merge, we will be able to capture that relationship.</p>

<p>As we see above, in this dataset, there is not much variability in the commits number. Majority of the PRs (77%) have 1 commit, 11% have 2 commits and rest(12%) have more than 2 commits. We can break commits number down into 3 categorical variables, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">contains_1_commit</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">contains_2_commits</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">contains_3_or_more_commits</span></code>. However, there might be some value in knowing whether a PR had 5 commits vs. 10 commits. So we will treat it as a numerical variable to begin with.</p>

<h1>Conclusion<a class="headerlink" href="#conclusion" title="Permalink to this headline">#</a></h1>
<p>This notebook walked through how to access and engineer features from the the relevant PR data for repos on the Thoth Station Org. We also outlined what is contained in each record and provided a quick demonstration of how to convert the mixed data types into numerical values for statistical analysis and eventually machine learning.</p>
<p>We have also engineered some possible features which can be used to predict time to merge of a PR. As next steps, we will train a classifier to predict time to merge of a PR using the features.</p>
