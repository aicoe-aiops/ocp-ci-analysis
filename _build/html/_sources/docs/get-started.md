# Get Started

The aim of the AI for continuous integration(AI4CI) project is to build an open AIOps community involved in developing, integrating and operating AI tools for CI by leveraging the open data that has been made available by OpenShift, Kubernetes and others. Check out the [project overview](../README.md) for a detailed overview of this project.
